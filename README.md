## Future

### gabs 3.1

For it I have a big plan. First, a more professional website. Based on the current one. Why not a new project? Well, the plan I have is to adapt the current code of the website into a new, better one. I don't want to start a new project, I want to continue it till I make it the best. That's why I will have to use this code for the next 5 years or so. But it's not going to stay like this. Yes, maybe the main code will be the same, but it's not going to look the same (kinda). I still don't know how it will look. But it's going to be a big project. Below you will see what I have planned:

* ~~Domain~~
* ~~Better pages~~
  * ~~About Me~~
  * ~~Projects~~
  * ~~Find Me~~
* A header
* ~~CSS Revamp~~
* Make the code look better (with the help of AI)

That's all right now, with time this will build up
